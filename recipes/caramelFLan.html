    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>(8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

            <li>In a small, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, cook sugar, stirring, until golden. Pour into a 10 inch round baking dish, tilting to coat bottom and sides. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until well incorporated. Beat in condensed and evaporated milk and vanilla until smooth.
