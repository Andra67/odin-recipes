    <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 pound ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li></li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the middle of the oven.</li>
        <li>Beat the cream cheese, ricotta cheese, and sugar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a time.
